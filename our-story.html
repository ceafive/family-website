        <p class="leading-tight text-2xl text-justify xxs:px-6 lg:pl-12">This story, our story began some 7 years ago today. It was a fine sunny Saturday morning, 
          my group and I were going on a quarterly charity trip to the Volta Region. Into the bus entered this damsel, when I saw her I knew she was the one for me.
          We became good friends after that and she was really really cool. Fast forward, life got hectic and I left the country for a bit and we stopped talking like we used to. <br> <br>

          In the wake of December 25th last year I received a gift, it was her, Theodora Maame Esi Torto, she messaged me on Instagram and wished me Merry Christmas. I was in a very 
          very bad place and that message restructured every aching muscle on my face and I smiled. We talked about all and every thing, we talked about how much I had missed her and she has always been the one for me.
          I got back to Ghana on the 30th of January, 2019 and I popped the question, the heart wrenching question, "Will you marry me?". She hesitated, my heart flinched and she smiled and said yes. I didn't get lucky, I am blessed. - <span class="text-gray-500">Eyram</span>
